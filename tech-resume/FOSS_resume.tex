\section{Summary}
I am an inquisitive, effective, and creative statistician and data scientist with extensive skills in three broad areas.
\textbf{Statistics and machine learning}, including regression, prediction, hypothesis testing, classification, clustering, and data visualization.
\textbf{Computing}, including experience with various programming languages (including R, python, BASH, SQL, C, and Go) and experience with high performance computing techniques such as parallel programming, map-reduce, and cluster computing.
\textbf{Technical communication}, including presentations at international statistics conferences and to colleagues at institutions such as Google, Yale, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

\section{Experience}

 {\bf University at Buffalo, Dept of Biostatistics}, Buffalo, NY\\
 {\it Research Assistant} \hfill {\bf June 2013 -- Present} \\
 Principal Investigator: Dr. Marianthi Markatou 
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Developed a novel technique for clustering mixed-type data that outperforms competing methods (Foss et al. 2016); implemented in R/Rcpp and Hadoop
  \item Worked with collaborators at the University at Buffalo and IBM Watson Labs to develop algorithms for clustering mixed continuous and categorical data subject to measurement error
  \item Designed, implemented, and analyzed Monte Carlo simulation studies on clusters of up to 200 cores, using R and MPI for parallelization
 \end{itemize}

 {\bf Google}, Mountain View, CA\\
 {\it Tech Intern} \hfill {\bf Summer 2015} \\
 Host: Dr. Ben Davison
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Used theoretical techniques and user data to develop optimal statistical procedures for analyzing user satisfaction
  \item Contributed high-performance algorithms for the analysis and visualization of satisfaction data to internal analysis tools
  \item Gave a talk introducing and justifying these testing procedures to 20+ Google user experience researchers. A 10-year veteran said my talk was one of the best intern presentations he's ever seen.
 \end{itemize}
