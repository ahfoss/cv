\section{Summary}
I am an inquisitive, effective, and creative biostatistician with extensive skills in three broad areas.
\textbf{Statistics}, including high-dimensional data analysis, linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models, cluster analysis, and data visualization.
\textbf{Computing}, including experience with various programming languages (including R, python, BASH, SQL, C, and Go) and with high performance computing techniques such as parallel programming, map-reduce, and cluster computing.
\textbf{Technical communication}, including presentations at international statistics conferences and to colleagues at institutions such as Google, Yale, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
